    </p>
    <h3>Service Providers</h3>
    <p>

      assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
      disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

      striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But
      remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of
      electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its
      absolute security.

      This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a

      external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to

        These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not
        knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children
        under 13 years of age. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has
        provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this
        personal information from any servers used by the Service. If you are a
        parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us
        with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to
        do the necessary actions.
